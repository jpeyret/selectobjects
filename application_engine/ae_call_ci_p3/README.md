# Part 3 Appendix (Records and Application Engine schema)

### The Application Engine

(we care about the part in the blue box)

`SQL.Main.reset`

This is where we reset the rows for processing, with `S` for *Staged*. Looking at `Y` means *loaded already*. `B`, which the CI wrapper does not care about, means *Blocked*. And `D` means *Delete*, which we are not using here.

	UPDATE PS_TCI_SOURCE
	SET SET_NOTIFY_FLAG = 'S' ,MESSAGE_TEXT_254 = ' '
	WHERE SET_NOTIFY_FLAG NOT IN ('Y', 'B', 'D') ;

`SQL.Main.loop`

	%Select(EMPLID, AE2CIAET.SET_NOTIFY_FLAG)
	SELECT EMPLID
	, CASE SET_NOTIFY_FLAG WHEN 'D' THEN 'D' ELSE 'I' END
	FROM PS_TCI_SOURCE /* S stands for staged here */
	WHERE SET_NOTIFY_FLAG IN ('S','D')
	ORDER BY EMPLID ;


#### `SQL.load1row.updMsg`:

This step is very important for loop management and user feedback. Coming after `load1row.callCI`, which calls the wrapper, its job is to take the notification and message fields in `Record.AE2CIAET` and put them into the data record (`TCI_SOURCE`) for that EMPLID. At this point, the CI's response codes have NOT been written to the database yet, since there was always the possibility of a rollback.

	UPDATE PS_TCI_SOURCE
  	SET MESSAGE_TEXT_254 = %Bind(AE2CIAET.MESSAGE_TEXT_254), SET_NOTIFY_FLAG = %Bind(AE2CIAET.SET_NOTIFY_FLAG)
 	WHERE EMPLID = %Bind(EMPLID)



#### `Record.AE2CI`:

This is the *communication* Record used to exchange information without saving into the database (remember those CI-initiated rollbacks).

Fairly basic record, which only has 2 fields the wrapper cares about.  Those fields are typically already present in this form in any recent PeopleTools environment.  `Field.MESSAGE_TEXT_254` receives error/success messages intended for the end user.
`Field.SET_NOTIFY_FLAG` receives 1 character codes indicating the result of the CI processing and its default values/meaning are: 


Value 	| Meaning
------------ | -------------
I 	|initiated processing
Y 	|data successfully loaded by CI
N 	|data error, rejected by CI
F 	|Technical/coding Exception


Both those fieldâ€™s names can easily be overridden in the CI wrapper constructor and so can the status values the wrapper uses to communicate. This allows you to use fields and codes that correspond more closely to your requirements.

	method Wrap_CI_JOB_DATA
	   %Super = create AE2CI:CiWrapper(CompIntfc.CI_JOB_DATA);
	   %Super.msg_fieldname = "MESSAGE254";
	   %Super.notify_exception = "E";  /* E, instead of F, is how technical exceptions are notified */
	end-method;

### `Record.TCI_SOURCE`

This is **your** data record that you want to load.
